All the Models must be edited! @JsonAnnotation(anyMap: true)  must be added.
fromJson  and toJson must receive Map only not Map<String, dynamic>
API call is simple by passing invokeMethod in GetRunApiFetchAction.
ex: appStore.dispatch(GetRunApiFetchAction("sync.setAuth)

The API result is handled by checking Map? res == null
If any error occurs in the API, error is shown automatically.
The result must be handled only! KEEP IN MIND PLEASE!
